# Rollkit

Rollkit is the open modular framework for sovereign rollups. Their mission is to empower developers to quickly innovate and create entire new classes of rollups with minimal tradeoffs.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/cw-orch-networks/src/networks/rollkit.rs:rollkit}}
```

## Usage

See how to setup your main function in the [main function](../contracts/scripting.md#main-function) section. Update the network passed into the `Daemon` builder to be `networks::LOCAL_ROLLKIT`.

## Compatibility

This integration has been tested using the [Rollkit Setup with CosmWasm](https://rollkit.dev/tutorials/cosmwasm). The following versions were used:

- Mocha testnet node: `celestia/v0.15.0.beta.1`
- Rollup node: `wasmd/v0.50.0` (which opens up port 9290 locally)
- In order to use `cw-orchestrator` with this setup, the `LOCAL_MNEMONIC` [environment variable](../contracts/env-variable.md) needs to be assigned. You can find the right value for this mnemonic in the beginning of the console logs generated by the `bash init.sh` command in [the official RollKit docs](https://rollkit.dev/tutorials/cosmwasm#initialize-rollup).
