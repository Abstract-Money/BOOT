# Setup

In this tutorial, you will find information on how to setup your working directory for cw-orchestrator integration. Because of the nature of smart contracts working directories, we have 2 separate tutorials depending on your setup : 

- [Single Contract setup tutorial](../setup/single-contract.md), if you're working with **a single contract**.
- [Workspace setup tutorial](../setup/workspace/index.md), if you're working with **multiple contracts** within a cargo workspace environment.
