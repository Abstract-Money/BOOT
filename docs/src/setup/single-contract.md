# Single Contract Crate Setup

You can find the code for this example in the <a href="https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-orchestrator/tree/main/contracts/counter" target="_blank">cw-orch counter-contract folder</a>.

If you are a fast or visual learner, you can find a <a href="https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-orch-counter-example/compare/e0a54b074ca1a894bb6e58276944cf2013d152f2..17f505758734fd3cfe3b4f7cede341376c930e98" target="_blank">**Before**-**After**</a> view of the `cw-orch` integration process in the sample contract.

## Dependency

Before we can create an interface we need to add cw-orch to the contract's `Cargo.toml` file. In `counter` run:

```shell
$ cargo add cw-orch
> Adding cw-orch v0.16.0 to dependencies.
```

or add it manually to the `counter/Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
cw-orch = {version = "0.21.2" } # Latest version at time of writing
```

Even if you include `cw-orch` in your dependencies here, it won't be included in your `wasm` contract. Learn more about this behavior in the section about [Wasm Compilation](../contracts/wasm-compilation.md).

## Crate Structure

Now that we have our dependency set up, we can create the files that will contain our interface. We will create that interface in an `interface.rs` file inside the crate (`counter/src/interface.rs`). Then, we need to include that file inside our project. However, that file will contain multiple `cw-orch` elements that are not exposed when compiling your WASM. In order to prevent errors when compiling for Wasm, we will import our `interface.rs` file and target-flag it like so, in `counter/src/lib.rs`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../contracts/counter/src/lib.rs:custom_interface}}
```

In the next section, we will learn how to define the interface to be able to interact with an actual contract inside this `interface.rs` file.


## Final structure

Following the steps above, the directory structure should eventually look like this:

```path
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── artifacts
│   └── counter_contract.wasm (binary file)
└── counter
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── bin
    │   └── deploy.rs
    └── src
        ├── contract.rs (execute, instantiate, query, ...)
        ├── msg.rs (ExecuteMsg, QueryMsg, ...)
        ├── interface.rs (`cw-orch` contract structure definition)
        └── ..
```

> **NOTE**:
>
> - The artifacts folder is generated by the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer" target="_blank">rust-optimizer</a>, and contains all your compiled contracts
> - Place your scripts inside the `bin` directory. Those can be run using the following command:
>
>     ```bash
>     cargo run --bin deploy
>     ```

Now that the setup is complete, you can go back to the [Contracts](../contracts/index.md) page to create the interface for your contract and start scripting/testing your contracts withe ease.
