# Workspace `cw-orch` setup process

 In all this tutorial, we will use the <a href="https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-plus" target="_blank">`cw-plus`</a> package as an example. This repository is maintained by `CosmWasm` and contains standard contracts. It's also a good workspace structure example.

## Crate setup

If you are using multiple contracts in a single project, we advise you to centralize all the interfaces to your contracts in a single location. To do so, go inside your `packages` folder and create a new `interface` library crate:

```bash
cargo new interface --lib
cd interface
```

Then, going into this crate, we need to add `cw-orch` as a dependency:

```bash
cargo add cw-orch --package interface 
```

## Individual contract interface

Now inside this crate, you can add the interfaces to all your contracts individually. A sane way to do so is to create a new file (also called module) for each contract. For instance, <a href="https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-plus/tree/main/packages/interface" target="_blank">the `interface` folder in the `cw-plus` repository</a> has the following structure:

```path
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── cw1_subkeys.rs
    ├── cw1_whitelist.rs
    ├── cw20_base.rs
    ├── cw20_ics20.rs
    ├── cw3_fixed_multisig.rs
    ├── cw3_flex_multisig.rs
    ├── cw4_group.rs
    ├── cw4_stake.rs
    └── lib.rs
```

Inside each file, you can define your contract interface. You can find the tutorial for that in the dedicated [Interfaces page](../../contracts/interfaces.md).

## Scripts

We advise using a `scripts` crate at the root of your workspace. This will help you centralize your scripts and have them easily accessible for eventual other users accessing your crate remotely. This crate should be a binary crate:

```bash
cargo new --bin scripts
```

## Final project structure

Following the steps above, the directory structure should eventually look like this:

```path
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── artifacts
│   ├── other_contract.wasm
│   └── my_contract.wasm
├── contracts
│   ├── my-contract
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       ├── contract.rs (execute, instantiate, query, ...)
│   │       └── ..
│   └── other-contract
│       └── ..
├── packages
│   ├── my-project (messages)
│   │   ├── Cargo.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       ├── lib.rs
│   │       ├── my-contract.rs
│   │       ├── other-contract.rs
│   │       └── ..
│   └── my-project-interface (interface collection, renamed here)
│       ├── Cargo.toml
│       └── src
│           ├── lib.rs
│           ├── my-contract.rs
│           ├── other-contract.rs
│           └── ..
└── scripts (executables)
    ├── .env
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        ├── deploy.rs
        └── test_project.rs
```

> **NOTE**:
>
> - The artifacts folder is generated by the <a href="https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer" target="_blank">workspace-optimizer</a>, and contains all your compiled contracts
> - We advise you to place your scripts inside the `scripts` crate to centralize them and facilitate retrieving them:

Now that the setup is complete, you can go back to the [Contracts](../../contracts/index.md) page to create the interfaces for your contracts one by one and start scripting/testing your contracts with ease.
