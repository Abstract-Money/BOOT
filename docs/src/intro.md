# BOOT Guide (v0.2.0)

Once you have written your CosmWasm smart contract, you are probably ready to start writing integration tests or deploy it to a live network. Doing this through a frontend interface or CLI tool is laborious and error-prone.

[BOOT](https://github.com/Abstract-OS/BOOT) (by [Abstract](https://abstract.money)) simplifies all of this by providing a type-safe library and standard for deploying and interacting with your CosmWasm smart contracts.
