// In this function, we need to :
// 1. Get all ibc outgoing messages from the transaction
// attribute type : send_packet
// Things to track
// connection
// dest-port
// dest_channel
// packet_sequence
// timeout_timestamp (for stopping the search) - Not needed here

// 2.  For each message find the transaction hash of the txs the message during which the message is broadcasted to the distant chain
// This only works for 2 chains for now, we don't handle more chains

// 3. Then we look for the acknowledgment packet that should always be traced back during this transaction for all packets

/// Follow all IBC packets included in a transaction (recursively).
/// ## Example
/// ```no_run 
///  use cw_orch::prelude::{DaemonAsync};
///
///  let grpc_channel = DaemonAsync::builder()
///     .chain("juno-1")
///     .build().await.unwrap()
///     .channel().unwrap();
///
/// follow_trail(
///         "juno-1".to_string()
///         grpc_channel,
///         "2E68E86FEFED8459144D19968B36C6FB8928018D720CC29689B4793A7DE50BD5".to_string()
/// ).await.unwrap();
/// ```

/// Following the IBC documentation of packets here : https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/main/IBC.md
/// This function has 3 steps, needed to follow the lifetime of an IBC packet :
///
/// 1. Send Packet. The provided transaction hash is used to retrieve all transaction logs from the sending chain.
///     In the logs, we can find all details that allow us to identify the transaction in which the packet is received in the distant chain
///     These include :
///     - The connection_id
///     - The destination port
///     - The destination channel
///     - The packet sequence (to identify a specific packet in the channel)
///
///     ## Remarks
///     - The packet data is also retrieved for logging
///     - Multiple packets can be sent out during the same transaction.
///         In order to identify them, we assume the order of the events is the same for all events of a single packet.
///         Ex: packet_connection = ["connection_id_of_packet_1", "connection_id_of_packet_2"]
///         Ex: packet_dst_port = ["packet_dst_port_of_packet_1", "packet_dst_port_of_packet_2"]
///     - The chain id of the destination chain is not available directly in the logs.
///         However, it is possible to query the node for the chain id of the counterparty chain linked by a connection
///
/// 2. Receive packet. For each packet received, we use the identification of the packet that was sent in the original tx to find the tx in which the packet was received
///     We make sure that only one transaction tracks receiving this packet.
///         If not, we sent out an error (this error actually comes from the code not identifying an IBC packet properly)
///         If such an error happens, it means this function is not implemented properly
///         We verify this transaction is not errored (it should never error)
///     
/// 3. Acknowledgment. The last part of the packet lifetime is the acknowledgement the distant chain sents back.
///     a. Identify acknowledgement
///         In the same transaction as the one in which the packet is received, an packet acknowledgement should be sent back to the origin chain
///         We get this acknowledgment and deserialize it according to https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.42.4/proto/ibc/core/channel/v1/channel.proto#L134-L147
///         If the acknowledgement doesn't follow the standard, we don't mind and continue
///     b. Identify the acknowledgement receive packet on the origin chain
///         Finally, we get the transaction hash of the transaction in which the acknowledgement is received on the origin chain.
///         This is also logged for debugging purposes
///
/// 4. Finally, some additionnal packets may have been sent out during the whole process. We need to check the generated transactions for additional packets.
///    This 4th step make the whole process recursive. Those two transactions potentially sends out additional packets !
///         - The receive Packet transaction identified in 2. on the distant chain
///         - The receive Acknowledgement transaction identified in 3.b. on the origin chain
